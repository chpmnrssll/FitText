# Fit text with polynomial regression

There are many ways to fix text to the width of the parent. The first option from this CSS Tricks article <a href="https://css-tricks.com/fitting-text-to-a-container/">fitting text to a container</a> recommends using viewport units and a magic number to fit text in a container. The problem is, finding this magic number. My solution involves measuring the text width at a few font sizes on a hidden HTML5 canvas. Those sample measurements are fed into a <a href="https://github.com/RobertMenke/JS-Polynomial-Regression">JS-Polynomial-Regression</a> model which can then predict the font-size for any width container.

Font size can be predicted with as few as 3 sample measurements which is insanely fast compared to my first approach of measuring text widths while recursively increasing the font-size until they fit. It's not exact (especially on resize), but the fluid vw units are pretty close. Itâ€™s a trade-off of simplicity vs. accuracy.

## Usage

```javascript
import FitText from 'FitText';

document.addEventListener('readystatechange', () => {
  if (document.readyState === 'complete') {
    const fitText = new FitText();

    document.querySelectorAll('.fitElement').forEach((element) => {
      const results = fitText.element(element);
      element.style.fontSize = `${results.vw}vw`;
      element.style.lineHeight = `${results.vw}vw`;
    });
  }
});
```

```html
<section class="parent">
  <h3 class="fitElement" compress="1.0" minFontSize="16" maxFontSize="1024">Text to fit</h3>
</section>
```
